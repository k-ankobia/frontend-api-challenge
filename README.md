# Chitter API Frontend Challenge


Challenge:
-------

A Twitter clone that will allow the users to post messages to a public stream.

The scenario is similar to the [Chitter Challenge](https://github.com/makersacademy/chitter-challenge)


A front-end single-page-app that interacts with an api 
A backend API has already been built and hosted on Heroku.
Deployed at `https://chitter-backend-api.herokuapp.com/`



Frontend has been written using pre javascript and CSS 

[The API documentation is here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/chitter_api_backend)

## The Api supports the following interactions 


* Viewing all Peeps *(I suggest you start here)*

* Creating Users
* Logging in
* Posting Peeps

* Viewing individual Peeps
* Deleting Peeps
* Liking Peeps
* Unliking Peeps

We are looking for well tested, easy to read, easy to change code. This is more important than the number of interactions you implement.

Note that others may be doing the same task at the same time, so the data may change as you are using it.

## Useful Utilities

* [The Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) for making requests.
* [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)
